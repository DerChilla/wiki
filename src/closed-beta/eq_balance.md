## Important notice
All melee/ranged weapons:
- **Removed soft damage**
- Increased basic damage: baseDmg *= 1 + softChance * (1 + softDmg) 
(e.g: 40/35 soft dmg will result in 1 + 0.4 * (1 + 0.35) = 1.54 factor, 598~662 base dmg -> 921~1019 base dmg.)
- Not sure if it will be enough, but according to my DPS calculations (i took crits and soft dmg into account), the DPS should be more or less the same.

## Costumes

- I decided not to change a lot of costumes (it's still a lot of changes), as I am going to add "Wardrobe Closet" where you'll be able to change how you look by placing an item into its slot (it will be a Mini-Land structure), think Terraria vanity slots. This will make Costume Merge obsolete though.
